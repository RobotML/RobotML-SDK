         During this step, the user generate the PROTEUS simulator corresponding to its problem model and a chosen deployment. At this step, the simulator application could be non executable as there is probably for some of the underlying tools compilation to run and perhaps configuration(s) to apply.

      <description>
          The default destination for the generation is into the problem model project folder. The user could choose another destination because he / she prefers to work outside the platform for compilation, tracking, etc inside his / her preferred tool.
