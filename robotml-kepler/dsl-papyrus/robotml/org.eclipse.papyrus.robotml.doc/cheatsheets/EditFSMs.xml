         To specify a robotic system behavior, you can use finite state machines diagrams. Several FSMs can be attached to a robotic system.

         Go to the model explorer view and select the robotic system to which you want to describe the behavior through finite state machines.
Right click on it and choose the &quot;new diagram&quot; menu, then choose &quot;create new state machine diagram&quot;. A new finate state machine will be created and added to the ownedBevior list of the selected system. 
A new diagram will be created as well. In the next step you will graphically edit the FSM.
