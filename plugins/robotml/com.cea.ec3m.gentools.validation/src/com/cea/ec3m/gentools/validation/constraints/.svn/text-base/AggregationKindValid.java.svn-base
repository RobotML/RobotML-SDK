/**
 * Verify that aggregation kinds are used well. General rule:
 * attributes of a components should have aggregation kind "composite" unless
 * (1) the are singletons (implementation property), i.e. there is exactly one instance.
 * (2) they are *shared*. In this case an enclosing component has to define a property of same type
 * and name (open if "same name" restriction is kept, since it implies an implicit relationship
 * that would break after name changes. But it allows for having multiple shared properties of same type)
 * [it does not make a difference, whether "aggregation" or "none" is used as aggregation kind]
 * Alternative? give user a fine control in the instantiation model? Fractal: no need for a single
 * composed property?
